# LPM-Geomod_Suite
This is a geologic modeling suite plugins for AR2GEMS using signed distances functions and indicators.

## Installation
Paste the ui folder content to plugins\Geostat AR2GEMS folder and py folder content to plugins\Geostat\python AR2GEMS folder. helpers.py should go on Lib AR2GEMS folder.
If everything goes well you will see LPM-Geomod_Suite in the algorithms pannel.
